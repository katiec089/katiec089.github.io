<h3>Actually graduating</h3>

I officially graduated on Monday, May 22nd 2017. 

Okay, not a big deal because I got my diploma in the mail back in December. And I started working already in March. 

But it was an excuse for my parents to come, and it was certainly nice to see them. (Also for them to buy me all the food.)

It hit me (rather slowly, admittedly) that... I'm not likely going to ever be with them for long periods of time ever again. Like, I'm actually an adult now, working and on my own. I mean, I'm paying for my rent and insurance myself, bought my sofa and tv with my own money... It's weird. I still want to ask for permission whenever I want to do something, as if I don't believe in myself or trust myself with making decisions. 

"Should I go take a walk today?" "What time should I go to bed?" "Should I buy lunch today?" For some reason, I never feel like I'm making the right decision, even with these seemingly minor questions - my gut reaction is to get someone else to okay it first. 

I've been on my own now officially for a little over two months. I'm getting noticeably better at biting my tongue and shutting up that voice in my mind and just taking that first step.

I know the young adults of this era are known for their freedom and impulsiveness. That's a generalization. But I just always believed in doing what was expected of me and never deviating. I never considered gap years. I never considered spending money that I don't have in order to travel for my own enrichment. I never even became a crazy fangirl over anything like Justin Bieber. I was a quiet, meek child who did what she was told. 

Now that I'm not a student anymore, let's take that first step and try to deviate a little, yeah? ;)
