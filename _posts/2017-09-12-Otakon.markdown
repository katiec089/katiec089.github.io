<h3>Otakon 2017</h3>

In other words, WHY THE HELL DID WE MOVE IT TO DC 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN WALKING DISTANCE FROM MY APARTMENT IF IT STAYED IN BALTIMORE
NOOOOOO

#firstworldproblems

Anyway!

Posting a month late, but eventually got done. 

This year I had two cosplays planned: Warrior Sailor Moon and Organization XIII Xion.

Here's a personal disclaimer. I was actually making good time, and had a bit more planned for both cosplays. Of course, life never works out the way you want it. With less than a week's notice, I was told by a client that they needed me down in Atlanta for the week preceding Otakon. Of course, I was like, I'M FLYING HOME THURSDAY AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. (okay I wasn't that explicit) Regardless, it was a stressful time, as I had to fly back to Atlanta after Otakon and stay for two weeks. /End disclaimer

Xion's easy enough, really. I wish I had the time to make the ice cream. (I really wanted to drag a cooler around full of the real thing.) I just bought all the pieces and styled the wig the night before. Got2B hair products are like legit glue. Use it for wigs - but take some care.

Warrior Sailor Moon?

Well. 

Usually I end up buying cosplay pieces and putting it together. I've never made anything really from scratch. This time, I've made pretty much everything from scratch, and I had a ton of help from some new friends.

Generally speaking, the armor was made just out of craft foam. 4MM and 2MM, though I know some folks used 5MM and 8 MM for various pieces. Thicker foams for the pieces that require more form, like the chestpiece.

Blueprinting was just wrapping the body part in question with saran wrap and covering it with masking tape so that you could draw the shape of the piece. Cut it out and use it as a pattern on foam. For detailing, do the same thing but on the piece itself.

Same dealio with the chest piece! Though it was a little harder for me so I ended up freehanding a lot of it... Therefore, there are a lot of gaps and ugliness in the chestpiece. Oh well. It looks perfectly fine from afar!

With these foam pieces, after the detailing is done and glued on (with cement glue or the like), we sprayed layers of plastidip on it as kind of a primer. After that, we could acrylic paint it all and then use mod podge as a sealant and gloss. 

I don't know how to use a sewing machine well, and so Olivia and Clarisse helped with making boot covers and gloves for a few of us. That is definitely a goal of mine, to get a sewing machine and learn how to use it well. Definitely a project once I get a desk, haha.

I was lucky and Sailor Moon just so happened to have a pretty easy sword to deal with. I got a cheapo foam sword from Jo-Anns and just painted the hilt gold, then glued on the foam ball and moon.

Underneath the chestpiece is a corset. The detailing on that is just 2MM foam with thin fabric on it. Thanks to Olivia, it turned out wonderful.

The skirt ended up looking really good! I was really happy with it.

The biggest qualm I had was the wig. Not too big of a deal, I just hadn't ever dealt with a long wig before, let alone something as long as Sailor Moon's hair... 

Arda Wigs has a great tutorial <a href="https://www.arda-wigs.com/blogs/tutorials/how-to-style-a-sailor-moon-wig-by-antiquitydreams" target="_blank">here</a> that we followed for Sailor Moon and Sailor Cosmos wigs. That was one late night staying up and getting the balls done, but it turned out alright. I'm satisfied. Again, from afar it looks alright!

I then jetted off to Atlanta for work. 
I of course jetted back to Baltimore Thursday afternoon to get home, get my shit, and get on a train to DC. On my uber from BWI to home, I passed by the Baltimore Convention Center. And got a face full of Brony-con. Oh well.

Of course, I never did a cos-test and tried everything on before going to DC. No time. So. Hope and pray time that everything works. 

Friday was Xion. Willis did Roxas. Glad the cosplay itself was simple. Last minute wig fixing, with Got2B. That shit is like super glue.

My Sailor Moon shots were pretty snazzy! We had group shots and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/chocoboxstudios/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1409357715849403" target="_blank">individual</a> shots.

Super happy with how everything turned out. Here's to next year!
