<h3>Katsucon 2018</h3>

<h4>Also Birthday Buddy J-Hope's birthday</h4>

<h4>Which means my birthday</h4>

<h5>which means ohgodmakeitstop</h5>

We say hello to the Year of the Golden Dog, and I cry because time just keeps getting faster. Age is just a number, but time is still precious, I think.

I spent my birthday weekend at National Harbor, DC, for Katsucon 2018. Surprisingly, with lots of acquaintances and friends. I even got an awkward and semi-muttered Happy Birthday song in the middle of the Merchant's Hall!

I took it easy and did not prepare any new cosplays. The only things I did was buy a Kon doll for Rukia and fix up her gloves, really. Did Xion again.

Cons are tiring, but good every once in a while for me. If anything, I've felt more motivated to actually do things. (I guess it didn't help that I was sick for 3 weeks leading up to the convention.) I definitely want to get on with learning how to make things. Sewing, crafing, the like. My goal would be to make a Love Live (Nico) and a Yuri on Ice (Yurio) cosplay this year.

The weekend was pretty cool as well on the other side of the world. NBC was just the second channel or so on the tv in the hotel, so that was often on for the Winter Olympics. Very exciting and happy for Yuzu!! Pooh bear king reigns supreme. Congrats to smol Shoma and badass Javi. I knew from a mile away that the pressure on Nathan would come crashing down, and it did. But he certainly redeemed himself with that long program. Between him and Vincent, US certainly has amazing potential for 2022!

(Also, congrats to ShibSibs for dat bronze yas get it)

Not much else this weekend; I took it easy and had an enjoyable con with friends. We took pictures, ate expensive-ass cheap food, and I went to one panel about IP and rights in the industry. Haha.

Now back to work.
